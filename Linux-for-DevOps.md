## ðŸš€6.File and Directory Management
 - ### ðŸŒŸBasic File and Directory Operations
    - ### ðŸŽ‰Creating, Deleting, Moving, and Copying Files/Directories
    - [ ] Commands
    - [ ] `ls` - list files and directories
      - [ ] `-a` for listing hidden files
      - [ ] `-l` for list formt
      - [ ] `-t` order by time
      - [ ] `-F` better distinguish between regular files and directories
    - [ ] `touch` - creating files (original intention is updating timestamp)
      - [ ] nice to know: `touch file{1..5}`
    - [ ] `rm` - remove files
      - [ ] `-r` for recursive
      - [ ] `-f` to force removal, no questions asked
    - [ ] `mkdir` - create directories
      - [ ] `-p` - for creating multiple nested directories
    - [ ] `rmdir` - remove directories
    - [ ] `echo` - display a line of text
    - [ ] `cat` - concatenate files (common usage: read a file)
    - [ ] `mv` - move files directories (also rename files and directories)
    - [ ] `cp` - copy a file
      - [ ] `-r` for recursive (copy a directory)

 - ### ðŸŒŸFile/Directory Types
    - [ ] **Regular**\
   You can identify regular files using ls -l, where the file type is indicated by a dash **(-)** at the beginning of the permission string
       - [ ] `ls -l`
       - [ ] `-rw-r--r--  1 user user  1048576 Oct 21 14:34 example.txt`

    - [ ] Directory
    - [ ] Socket
    - [ ] Block
    - [ ] Link
