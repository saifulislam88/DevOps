 - ### ðŸŒŸBasic File and Directory Operations
    - ### ðŸŽ‰Creating, Deleting, Moving, and Copying Files/Directories
    - [ ] Commands
    - [ ] `ls` - list files and directories
      - [ ] `-a` for listing hidden files
      - [ ] `-l` for list formt
      - [ ] `-t` order by time
      - [ ] `-F` better distinguish between regular files and directories
    - [ ] `touch` - creating files (original intention is updating timestamp)
      - [ ] nice to know: `touch file{1..5}`
    - [ ] `rm` - remove files
      - [ ] `-r` for recursive
      - [ ] `-f` to force removal, no questions asked
    - [ ] `mkdir` - create directories
      - [ ] `-p` - for creating multiple nested directories
    - [ ] `rmdir` - remove directories
    - [ ] `echo` - display a line of text
    - [ ] `cat` - concatenate files (common usage: read a file)
    - [ ] `mv` - move files directories (also rename files and directories)
    - [ ] `cp` - copy a file
      - [ ] `-r` for recursive (copy a directory)

 - ### ðŸŒŸFile/Directory Types
    - [ ] **ðŸŒ±Regular `-`**\
   You can identify regular files using ls -l, where the file type is indicated by a dash **(-)** at the beginning of the permission string
       - [ ] `touch example.txt`
       - [ ] `ls -l`
       - [ ] `-rw-r--r--  1 user user  1048576 Oct 21 14:34 example.txt`\
       **Text files:** `example.txt`\
       **Binary files:** `/usr/bin/bash`\
       **Executable scripts:** `script.sh`
    - [ ] **ðŸŒ±Directory -`d`**\
   Directories can be identified by a **`d`** at the beginning of the permission string when using `ls -l`
      - [ ] `mkdir /home/msi/devops/linux -p`
      - [ ] `ls -l`
      - [ ] `drwxr-xr-x  2 msi msi  4096 Oct 21 14:40 linux\`
      **Home directory: /home/user**\
      **System configuration directories: /etc, /var**
    - [ ] **ðŸŒ±Socket -`s`**\
   Socket files are identified by an **`s`** at the beginning of the permission string in `ls -l`.
      - [ ] $ `ls -l /var/run/rpcbind.sock`
      - [ ] `srw-rw----  1 root docker 0 Oct 21 14:43 /var/run/rpcbind.sock`
    - [ ] **ðŸŒ±Block -`s`**\
   Block device files are identified by a **`b`** in the permission string from the `ls -l` command.
      - [ ] `ls -l /dev/sda`
      - [ ] `brw-rw----  1 root disk 8, 0 Oct 21 14:44 /dev/sda`
    - [ ] **ðŸŒ±Link -`l`**\
   Symbolic links are indicated by an `l` at the beginning of the permission string when using `ls -l`
      - [ ] `ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link`
      - [ ] `ls -l`
      - [ ] `lrwxrwxrwx  1 user user 9 Oct 21 14:45 mylink -> example.txt`
    - [ ] **ðŸŒ±Hidden file/dir -`.`**\
   Files or directories that begin with a dot `.` are hidden from normal directory listings.
      - [ ] `ls -la /home/msi/`
      - [ ] `-rw-r--r-- 1 msi  msi  3771 Oct 19 21:56 .bashrc`
